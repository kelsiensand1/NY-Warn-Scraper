          Covid-19 has caused devastating layoffs across the country. And New
          York state is no exception. Although anecdotes about people losing
          their jobs in the restaurant industry are powerful, there is also data
          to dovetail those claims. <span class="midterm">2018 midterms</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Using New York Stateâ€™s Department of Labor statistics, I was able to
          filter through data regarding layoffs and further analyze how
          restaurants in New York county were affected. According to the data,
          342 restaurants laid off employees since December of 2019, and there
          was a dramatic increase starting in March which coincides with when
          Governor Cuomo ordered New York to shut down.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Homing in further into the numbers, 17,326 people were laid off of the
          342 restaurants. This devastating total complements the narratives we
          hear left and right about people losing their jobs in the service
          industry. <a
